DISCLAIMER
This bot is poorly written, I take no responsibility if anything happens at
all, even remotely, to you, your system, your network, your girlfriend, your
pet, your family, your imaginary friend, your house, your porn, or anything
at all that may come as a result of the usage, viewing, editing, etc. of this
code.
If it is so horrible that your eyes melt onto your laptop, causing it to 
short-circuit, explode, and kill you, that is *your responsibility*.

ABOUT
This bot was originally written to sort-of mock someone who used emotes on
IRC a lot, however, it was sort of welcomed, and after getting tired of
having to restart it repeatedly to add channels, patterns to regex, etc. I
threw those into files and made the bot somewhat modular, in that it can 
reload the variables as they are changed.

TODO
 > Make it very much less hackish
 > Tidy up the code
 > Specifically fix the part with the PING, that should probably be in an elif
   and use awk like the rest of the script
 > Fix channel-adding command so that it also escapes channels that might have
   other symbols (&, [, ., etc.)
 > Remember to actually do things on the TODO list rather than forget about it
 > Possibly add more things to the TODO list ??
